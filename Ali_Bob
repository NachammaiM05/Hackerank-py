TASK 5/6
Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity. originality, and difficulty.

The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

The task is to calculate their comparison points by comparing each category:

If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.

If all blil, then Bob is awarded 1 point.

If a[i] = biil, then neither person receives a point.

Example

a = [1.2.3] b=[3, 2, 1]

For elements "O", Bob is awarded a point because a[0] < b[0].

For the equal elements a[l] and b[1], no points are earned.

Finally, for elements 2, a[2] b[2] so Alice receives a point..

The return array is [1, 1] with Alice's score first and Bob's second.

Function Description

Complete the function compareTriplets with the following parameter(s):

int a[3]: Alice's challenge rating

int b[3]: Bob's challenge rating

Returns

int[2]: the first element is Alice's score and the second is Bob's score

Input Format

The first line contains 3 space-separated integers, a[0], a[l], and a[2], the respective values in triplet a.

The second line contains 3 space-separated integers, b[0], b[1], and b[2], the respective values in triplet b.

Constraints

1≤alil ≤ 100

1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 100

Sample Input O

567 3610

Sample Output O

11

Explanation O

In this example:

(a0, a1, a2) = (5, 6, 7)

b=(b[0], b[1], b[2]) = (3,6,10)

Now, let's compare each individual score:

a[0] b[0], so Alice receives 1 point.

a[1]b[1]. so nobody receives a point.

a/2) <6(2), so Bob receives 1 point.

Alice's comparison score is 1. and Bob's comparison score is 1. Thus, we return the array [1,1].

Sample Input 1

17 28 30

99 16 8

Sample Output 1

21

Explanation 1

Comparing the 0th elements, 1799 so Bob receives a point.

Comparing the 1 and 2nd elements, 28 > 16 and 30 > 8 so Alice receives two points. The return array is [2, 1]



SOLUTION:

def compareTriplets(a, b):
    Alice_Score = 0
    Bob_Score = 0

    for i in range(3):
        if a[i] > b[i]:
            Alice_Score += 1
        elif a[i] < b[i]:
            Bob_Score += 1

    return [Alice_Score, Bob_Score]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    result = compareTriplets(a, b)
    print(*result)
